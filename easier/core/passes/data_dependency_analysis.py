    When a Node/tensor X is used as an argument to another Node/operation F,

    similarily, when a argument Node/tensor Y is inplace modified by F,
    or the operation F allocates the memory of Y,
    we say F does a writing operation on the memory under Y.

    Along the node list as the original EASIER program runs, at different
    timings/Nodes, a memory may be modified (and maybe multiple times!).

    Any operation/Node that directly reads/writes a memory, cannot be
    reordered across any barrier formed by specifically that memory.
    (i.e. crossing barrier of other memory does not matter.)

    Nodes to express such barrier-like constraints.

        Given a Tensor instance and its underlying memory, an operator may
        behave in one or multiple following ways:

        -   view:
            The operator manipulates `Tensor.strides` etc. without touching
            the memory.

        -   read:
            The contents of the memory is read.

        -   write:
            The contents of the memory is modified.

        -   allocate:
            The operator allocates a new memory and a new Tensor.
            Generally followed by a write.

        P.S. the original Tensor-memory binding cannot be changed,
        e.g. `Tensor.set_()` is not supported by EASIER.

        If we were careful enough and checked down to the essentials
        -- which the current implementation of EASIER did not --
        we might find:
        -   `operator.getitem, torch.view` are view-only ops.

            View-only ops are neither read nor write, and are meaningless
            beyond dataflow (where Tensor.strides matter), i.e. the execution
            time of these ops can arbitarily moved around, as long as not
            breaking dataflow.

        -   `torch.reshape` is a view or an allocator.

        -   `easier.runtime.HaloExchanger` is read-only or an allocator.
            (when a HaloExchanger is for Selector and send-only, it returns
            the input Tensor as well as copying some of its contents)

        However, in order to get free from checking operator one-by-one,
        EASIER by default has policies:

        -   The operator is treated as a writer on all memory blocks
            it returns:
            a.  `operator.setitem, torch.fill_` are purely writers;
            b.  `torch.add(a,b), torch.svd()` are allocators,
                writing the newly allocated memory blocks;
            c.  `torch.view` is classfied as writers -- by the default policy.

        -   This method, _handle_readonly_or_allocation(),
                         ********************************
            can be used, in an allow-list manner, to specifically
            mark and handle an operator as a reader or a allocator,
            e.g. `operator.getitem, HaloExchanger`.

        Additionally, for the sake of simplicity, EASIER treats
        views as reads, view-only as read-only.
        For example, if we want to use this method to eliminate the
        "mis-classification" of `torch.view` in the case (c) above,
        we still have to treat it as read-only, rather than pure view.

        TODO Currently handle only getitem and HaloExchanger, since they have
        been identified as special cases for other purposes.

    talking about **multiple** Tensor instances pointing to the same memory.
    Since even a single Tensor is a view.

    Based on standard PyTorch programming model,
    EASIER programming model additionally requires, if an operation returns
    a view of its input, that operation must be followed by,
    immediately and exactly,
    a call to the function `torch.clone()` or the method `Tensor.clone()`.

    TODO maybe `Tensor.to(copy=True)` or whatever function that essentially
    clones.

    This requirement eliminates the cases that:
    -   EASIER programs deal with non-contiguous memory.

        Such memory and access pattern which makes it inefficient
        for CPU cache line, CUDA coalescing memory access etc.

    -   A view Tensor gets accidentally created and written.

        EASIER programs allow in-place Tensor modification, which is less
        common in PyTorch workloads.
        If a view gets accidentally written, it will casue big trouble
        both for users to realize it or for EASIER devs to
        systematically enhance the user experience.

    -   Following passes need to deal with views.

        By enforcing immediate `.clone()`, it leaves no space for extra
        control flow or deadlock in fusion,
        therefore we can consider it an atomic unit of operations
        that creates a new memory.

        If not immediate cloned, it may cause deadlock in fusion,
        and make views to be outputs of NodeGroups, e.g.:
        ```
        view = v.view(...)
        reducer(..., out=v)  # Reducer.out dataflow edge is cut
        clone = view.clone()  # Control-flow depended on reducer, deadlock
        ```

    This subpass covers:

    -   User-program view ops
        (e.g. operator.getitem, torch.view, torch.reshape)
        must be followed by torch/Tensor.clone;

        Including Nodes of both DIST and REPLICA roles.

    -   EASIER-inserted Nodes may return a view, e.g. HaloExchanger,
        as long as it has only one user and the user isn't a view,
        we don't check it.

        Also, it won't be fused.

    -   Inplace ops
        (e.g. operator.setitem, Reducer, torch.add_, Tensor.fill_):
        If they have users, the users must be clone() too.
